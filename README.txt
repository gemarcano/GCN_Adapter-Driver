This is a KMDF driver, working as a filter driver in front of (or really, below) the Microsoft supplied HID class driver (Windows 7 and up, sorry Vista).

There is no installer yet made, sorry. I'll work on that as soon as I can. In the meantime, if you can get this to compile, you could try to install it by hand via the .inf file.

This software is dual-licensed under the LGPLv3 and GPLv2 or later. I am not closed to the idea of licensing this software under a BSD license if someone were to present me a convincing enough argument, so ask me if there are any questions or concern. I can be contacted with questions about licensing at gabemarcano at yahoo dot com.
