------------------------------------
Setup
------------------------------------
After building the driver from source, depending on your architecture, navigate
to "%ARCH%\%Windows Version%\GCN_Adapter Package" and verify that the following
files are there: 	
	gcn_adapter.cat
	GCN_Adapter.inf
	GCN_Adapter.sys
	WdfCoinstaller01011.dll
	
If so, the driver is ready to be installed. If not, try recompiling the
driver. These files should be put there by the compilation process, so make
sure Visual Studio 2013 is installed properly and that WDK 8.1 is installed.

------------------------------------
Windows Test Mode
------------------------------------
One of the problems with the driver is that it is not signed by default. This
will cause for it to not be installable in modern Windows systems. The only
way to get around this limitation is to make Windows enter into Test mode.
This can be done by the following commands on the command prompt when launched
as an Administrator:
	bcdedit.exe -set loadoptions DDISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS
	bcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING ON
	
Windows needs to be restarted for this to take effect.
	
If for some reason one wants to delete the driver and/or re-enable Windows 
driver checking, do:
	bcdedit.exe -deletevalue loadoptions
	bcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING OFF

These commands will allow Windows to resume normal operation. This will also 
prevent the driver from working, since it is not signed.

------------------------------------
Installation (Requires Windows Test Mode)
------------------------------------
Plug in the adapter and watch Windows fail to find a driver. If at any time 
Windows asks you for an installation disk or something of the sort, the 
"GCN_Adapter Package" directory is that installation disk. Select "Have disk" 
and navigate to the Package directory, and select the .inf file. The driver 
should now be installed.

If Windows did not prompt for a disk or just said that it failed, to install 
the proper driver navigate to the device manager. One way to do this is to 
press Win+R and then input
	mmc devmgmt.msc

At the install manager, find the USB device that failed to install (it should 
have a yellow warning sign on its icon). Right click on it, go to the Details 
tab, and on the scroll down menu select "Hardware Ids". Verify that one of the 
Ids matches with this:
	USB\VID_057E&PID_0337&REV_0100

If it matches, this is the right device. If not, keep searching. If it is the 
right device, go to the Driver tab, and press the "Update Driver..." button. 
Select "Browse my computer for driver software"->"Let me pick from a list of 
device drivers on my computer"->"Have Disk..." . Now browse to the Package 
directory and select the GCN_Adapter.inf file. Windows will complain about the 
driver being unsigned, but select to continue with the installation. That 
should be it!

------------------------------------
Testing
------------------------------------
To make sure that the driver is loaded properly, in the device manager there 
should be 4 new HID controllers under the "Human Interface Devices" list, and 
there should be one "Gamecube Controller Adapter" listed. To test the 
controllers, find Devices and Printers in Windows, right click on the Adapter 
from the device list, and select "Game controller settings." From these 
settings, select the controller to test (they should be in order) and click 
properties. Pressing buttons should cause for the status dialog to change, as 
well as moving the analog sticks.
